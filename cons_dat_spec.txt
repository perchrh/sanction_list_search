                      DATA SPECIFICATION 
                      
First Released:   10/10/2014


PLEASE NOTE IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING THE TECHNICAL STRUCTURE OF THESE
FILES ARE FEATURED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE DOCUMENT

     OFAC is publishing consolidated data format versions of its Non-Specially
Designated Nationals (SDN) Lists.  The "Consolidated List" contains designation
and target information from OFAC’s Non-SDN, Palestinian Legislative Council List
(NS-PLC List), the Part 561 List, the Non-SDN Iran Sanctions Act List (NS-ISA
List), the Foreign Sanctions Evaders List (FSE List), and the Sectoral Sanctions
Identifications List (SSI List).

     OFAC is publishing its Consolidated List in a number of data formats. 
These electronic publications as transmitted by OFAC are designed as reference
tools providing actual notice of actions by OFAC with respect to OFAC's Non-SDN
lists. The latest changes may appear here prior to their publication in the
Federal Register, and it is intended that users rely on changes indicated in
these documents that post-date the most recent Federal Register publication.
Such changes reflect official actions of OFAC and will be reflected as soon as
practicable in the Federal Register under the index heading "Foreign Assets
Control."  New Federal Register notices with regard to the sanctions lists
administered by OFAC may be published at any time. Users are advised to check
the Federal Register  and these electronic publications routinely for additional
names or other changes to the listings. Entities and individuals on the list are
occasionally licensed by OFAC to transact business with U.S. persons in
anticipation of removal from the list or because of foreign policy
considerations in unique circumstances.  Licensing in anticipation of official
Federal Register publication of a notice of removal is reflected in these
publications by removal from the list.   

Technical Specification: 

Format *.del consists of records separated by carriage returns (ASCII character 
13), with fields (values) within records delimited by the "@" symbol (ASCII 
character 64).  Text values are enclosed by quotation marks (")(ASCII character 
34).  

Format *.ff consists of records separated by carriage returns, with fields 
within the records beginning at fixed locations.  

Format *.csv consists of records separated by carriage returns (ASCII character 
13), with fields (values) within records delimited by the "," (comma) symbol 
(ASCII character 44).  

Format *.PIP consists of records separated by carriage returns (ASCII character
13), with fields (values) within records  delimited by the "|" symbol (ASCII
character 124).  

Null values for all four  formats consist of "-0-" (ASCII characters 45, 48,
45).

     The  @ Delimited (.del), Comma Separated Values (.csv), Pipe  (|) delimited
(.pip) and Fixed-Field (.ff) releases consist of four ASCII text files--a main
file listing the name of the listing and other information unique to that entity
(cons_prim.*), a file of addresses (cons_add.*), a file of alternate names
(cons_alt.*), and a spillover file with additional identifying information
(cons_comments.*).  Addresses and alternate names are linked to particular
entries using unique integer values in a linking or primary key column. The
integers used are assigned for linking purposes only and do not represent an
official reference to that entity.

     Releases of the database-format files are intended as a service to the user
community.  OFAC's NS-PLC List, Part 561 List, NS-ISA List, FSE List and SSI
lists are published in the Federal Register.  All of OFAC's lists are drawn from
the same underlying data and every effort has been made to ensure consistency. 
The Federal Register will govern should differences arise.  Due to the nature,
urgency, and sensitivity of the programs  which OFAC administers and enforces,
it may not always be possible to provide advanced notice to users of format
changes to the database  structure.

     The files associated with each release are:

@ delimited:     CONS_PRIM.DEL, CONS_ADD.DEL, CONS_ALT.DEL, CONS_COMMENTS.DEL
| delimited:	   CONS_PRIM.PIP, CONS_ADD.PIP, CONS_ALT.PIP, CONS_COMMENTS.PIP
fixed field:     CONS_PRIM.FF,  CONS_ADD.FF,  CONS_ALT.FF,  CONS_COMMENTS.FF
Comma delimited: CONS_PRIM.CSV, CONS_ADD.CSV, CONS_ALT.CSV, CONS_COMMENTS.CSV
XML:  	         consolidated.XML	
Misc: cons_dat_spec.txt (this file), consolidated.xsd (XML Consolidated List
schema).

<<<PLEASE NOTE: WHILE PERSONS ON THE CONSOLIDATED LIST ARE NOT SDNS (UNLESS THEY
ARE ALSO LISTED ON THE SDN LIST) OFAC KEPT THE STANDARD SDN COLUMN HEADERS IN
ITS LEGACY FLAT FILES TO EASE THE INTEGRATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED LIST'S DATA
WITH EXISTING DATABASES AND SCREENING SYSTEMS. TREATMENT INFORMATION HAS BEEN
ADDED TO THE REMARKS FIELD FOR SOME OF THE ENTRIES TO FACILITATE APPROPRIATE
ACTION WHEN A TRUE HIT IS FOUND.  PROGRAM TAGS ARE ALSO USED TO DETERMINE THE
LIST THE ENTRIES ARE FROM.  FOR EXAMPLE, ENTRIES WITH THE PROGRAM TAG [NS-PLC]
ARE FROM THE NON-SDN PALESTINIAN LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL LIST.  THE SAME PROGRAM TAG
NOMENCLATURE IS USED ON THE CONSOLIDATED LIST AS ON OTHER OFAC LISTS.>>>

*SPILLOVER FILES:

OFAC has made certain changes to its list production system that now allow for 
an unlimited number of identifiers, features and linked to identifications to
be added to a record.  In the fixed-width and delimited files these data are 
stored in the remarks field.  Due to these changes, it is now possible for a
 record to exceed the 1000 character remarks limitation.  Data that exceeds
the specified field limit will be truncated to ensure that the current data
specification is followed.  However, in order to ensure that users of these
files continue to have access to truncated data, OFAC has created "spillover
files." These files will follow the same data specification of the files they
are associated with.  However, there will be no upper limit on row length in
these files.

The spillover file names will be:

cons_comments.csv
cons_comments.pip
cons_comments.ff
cons_comments.del

These files will be included in the Consolidated zip files and will be listed 
separately on the OFAC website's Consolidated List page.  They will also be
listed  separately in the /consolidated_list folder of OFAC's FTP sites.  



THE DISPOSITION OF ALIASES:

OFAC classifies aliases as weak or strong.  In the data files discussed in this
document, weak aliases are not stored in the CONS_alt.* files. Weak aliases are
stored in the remarks field that trails every primary record in the CONS_PRIM.*
files.  For more information on weak aliases  please review the following text
taken from the frequently asked questions  on OFAC's website.  

What are weak aliases (AKAs)?

A “weak AKA” is a term for a relatively broad or generic alias that may generate
a large volume of false hits.  Weak AKAs include nicknames, noms-de-guerre, and
unusually common acronyms.  OFAC includes these AKAs because, based on
information available to it, the sanctions targets refer to themselves, or are
referred to, by these names.  As a result, these AKAs may be useful for
identification purposes, particularly in confirming a possible “hit” or “match”
triggered by other identifier information.  Realizing, however, the large number
of false hits that these names may generate, OFAC qualitatively distinguishes
them from other AKAs by designating them as weak.  OFAC has instituted
procedures that attempt to make this qualitative review of aliases as objective
as possible.  Before issuing this updated guidance, OFAC conducted a review of
all aliases on the SDN list.  Each SDN alias was run through a computer program
that evaluated the potential of an alias to produce false positives in an
automated screening environment.  Names were evaluated using the following
criteria:

Character length (shorter strings were assumed to be less effective in a
screening environment than longer strings); 
The presence of numbers in an alias (digits 0-9); 
The presence of common words that are generally considered to constitute a
nickname (example: Ahmed the Tall); 
References in the alias to geographic locations (example: Ahmed the Sudanese); 
The presence of very common prefixes in a name where the prefix was one of only
two strings in a name (example: Mr. Smith).
Aliases that met one or more of the above criteria were flagged for human
review.  OFAC subject matter experts then reviewed each of the automated
recommendations and made final decisions on the flagging of each
alias.*

OFAC intends to use these procedures to evaluate all new aliases introduced to
its various lists. 

Where can I find weak aliases (AKAs)?
 
Weak AKAs appear differently depending on which file format of the Consolidated
List is utilized.
 
In the TXT and PDF versions of the NS-PLC, Part 561 List, NS-ISA List, FSE List
and the SSI List, weak AKAs are encapsulated in double-quotes within the AKA
listing:
 
ALLANE, Hacene (a.k.a. ABDELHAY, al-Sheikh; a.k.a. AHCENE, Cheib; a.k.a. "ABU
AL-FOUTOUH"; a.k.a. "BOULAHIA"; a.k.a. "HASSAN THE OLD");
DOB 17 Jan 1941; POB El Menea, Algeria (individual) [SDGT]
 
This convention also is followed in the alphabetical listing published in
Appendix A to Chapter V of Title 31 of the Code of Federal Regulations.  

In the DEL, FF, PIP, and CSV file formats, weak AKAs are listed in the Remarks
field (found at the end of the record) of the Consolidated file.  In these
formats, weak AKAs are bracketed by quotation marks.

8219@"ALLANE, Hacene"@"individual"@"SDGT"@-0- @-0- @-0- @-0- @-0- @-0- @-0-
@"DOB 17 Jan 1941; POB El Menea, Algeria; a.k.a. 'ABU AL-FOUTOUH'; a.k.a.
'BOULAHIA'; a.k.a. 'HASSAN THE OLD'."

In the XML version of the Consolidated List, there is a Type element for each
AKA.  The Type can either be 'weak' or 'strong' (see the XML Schema (XSD file)
at:  http://www.treasury.gov/ofac/downloads/consolidated/consolidated.xsd for
more information).  

Am I required to screen for weak aliases (AKAs)?
 
OFAC’s regulations do not explicitly require any specific screening regime. 
Financial institutions and others must make screening choices based on their
circumstances and compliance approach.  As a general matter, though, OFAC does
not expect that persons will screen for weak AKAs, but expects that such AKAs
may be used to help determine whether a “hit” arising from other information is
accurate.  

Will I be penalized for processing an unauthorized transaction involving a weak
alias (AKA)?

A person who processes an unauthorized transaction involving a designated person
has violated U.S. law and may be subject to an enforcement action. Generally
speaking, however, if (i) the only sanctions reference in the transaction is a
weak AKA, (ii) the person involved in the processing had no other reason to know
that the transaction involved a designated person or was otherwise in violation
of U.S. law, and (iii) the person maintains a rigorous risk-based compliance
program, OFAC will not issue a civil penalty against an individual or entity for
processing such a transaction.
